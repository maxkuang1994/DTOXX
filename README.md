DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1) Help and documentation:

We have included a help and documentation page in hanalove.herokuapp.com/help, so it's going to guide the users when they are using the application

2)Aesthetic and Minimalist design:

We have fetched data from 4-5 resources;however, we did not show all of them and hide the information that are irrelevant. More importantly, we use the flat minimalist design.

3)Consistency and standards:

Most design for the pages are consistent. For example, the buttons color are consistent in term of their functionalities or features.
